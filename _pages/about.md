POLY_ came about during the lockdown in the crazy year of 2020. Originally, much of what we made came in the form of creating playlists of niche genres on Spotify for fun, and from that, we curated and continue to curate music under the name POLYAUX. However, after a while, our inner-nerd wanted to know more about those genres, how they came to be, and the diverse people that enjoy it all. Before we even realized it, we started writing as POLYWRITE, investigating not only the music we enjoyed but the people, the science, the cultural impacts... everything. The support has been overwhelming, and honestly, words can't express how thankful we are for everyone that has been there along the way.
